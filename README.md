# BadTranslator

Translate whatever you want through ten different languages and then back to English.

## How it works

This is the front end, built with Flutter and hosted on Firebase.  
It queries a backend server (https://github.com/aacheng17/BadTranslatorAPI) for translations.
Get terrible translations to your heart's desire.
